            <h2>Introduction to Machine Learning: What Is and Its Applications</h2>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. This article explores the concept of machine learning, providing various definitions and discussing its applications.</p>

            <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves feeding data into algorithms that can then identify patterns and make predictions on new data.</p>
            <p>Applications include image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommender systems.</p>

            <h2>Why We Need Machine Learning?</h2>
            <p>Machine learning enables us to solve complex problems, handle large data volumes, automate tasks, and personalize user experiences. Here are the key reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solving Complex Business Problems:</strong> Tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and disease diagnosis are made possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Handling Large Volumes of Data:</strong> ML can process massive data to find insights, e.g., fraud detection, recommendations.</li>
                <li><strong>Automating Repetitive Tasks:</strong> ML automates spam filtering, customer support, and large-scale data processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized User Experience:</strong> Platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Facebook use ML for tailored recommendations.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Improvement:</strong> ML models improve over time based on data and feedback (e.g., voice assistants, search engines, self-driving cars).</li>
            </ul>
